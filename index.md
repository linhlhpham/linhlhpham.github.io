The music industry is a lucrative sector within the entertainment industry, generating billions of dollars annually. **With 114,000 Spotify tracks over a range of 125 different genres**, there is immense revenue potential to utilize business analytics to help music producers adapt to this evolving landscape, understand consumer preferences through track popularity, guide in the song-making process, enhance the overall listening experience for consumers, and ultimately increase customer loyalty and subscription.

#### Interesting findings:
- **Cluster 0** represents the popularity of Pop-films. The songs in this genre tend to be moderately popular when they have lower ‘danceability’ and ‘tempo’ and a more positive or happy emotional tone.
- **Cluster 1** represents the popularity of K-pop. Since ‘valence’ and ‘loudness’ have positive values, it indicates that songs in K-pop should have higher loudness and a generally positive mood.
- **Cluster 2** represents the popularity of Chill. Negative ‘tempo’ suggests a more relaxed or laid-back feel, whereas positive ‘danceability’ indicates a balanced level of rhythm suitable for dancing. 
- **Cluster 3** represents the popularity of Pop. Songs in this genre are relatively popular when the tracks are less explicit, less danceable and convey a less positive mood. Pop songs tend to be louder to attract listeners. 
- **Cluster 4** represents the popularity of Hip-hop. It is pretty expected that Hip-hop songs are likely to be more popular when they have a strong rhythm and cheerful mood, creating a lively feel when combined with high danceability. However, it’s interesting to note that songs in this genre should contain fewer explicit lyrics and fall within a moderate tempo range.
